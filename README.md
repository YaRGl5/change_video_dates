# change_video_dates
When uploading videos (MP4 from Google Photos, Telegram, etc.), all files can receive the same save date. This script corrects this by setting the creation, modification, and access date based on the file name. For example, video_2024-04-11_19-18-29 .mp4 â†’ 04/11/2024 19:18:29, so that the files are sorted correctly.
